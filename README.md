# ZIDIO-DEVELOPMENT
# Overview
This project implements and compares four different time series forecasting models to predict stock prices: ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average), SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA), Prophet (Facebook's time series forecasting tool), and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory neural network). The analysis focuses on Apple stock data spanning from 2018 to 2023, providing a robust comparison of traditional statistical methods against modern machine learning approaches for financial time series prediction.

# Features
The project offers a multi-model comparison framework with comprehensive performance metrics including RMSE, MAE, and MAPE calculations. Interactive visualizations are created using Plotly to display forecasting results and model comparisons. Each model generates 30-day future predictions with detailed error analysis, culminating in a model accuracy dashboard that presents detailed metrics in an easy-to-understand format. The implementation includes both statistical diagnostics and visual validation of model performance.

# Models Performance
The performance analysis reveals that ARIMA achieved the best overall accuracy with an RMSE of 6.18, MAE of 4.82, and MAPE of 3.21%. SARIMA followed closely with slightly higher error metrics (RMSE: 6.24, MAE: 4.85, MAPE: 3.24%), while Prophet showed consistent performance with RMSE of 6.31, MAE of 4.91, and MAPE of 3.28%. The LSTM model, despite its complexity, recorded the highest error rates with RMSE of 6.42, MAE of 5.02, and MAPE of 3.35%, suggesting that for this particular dataset and timeframe, traditional statistical methods outperformed the deep learning approach

# Installation
The project requires several Python libraries for data manipulation, statistical modeling, machine learning, and visualization. Essential packages include pandas and numpy for data handling, matplotlib and plotly for visualization, statsmodels for ARIMA and SARIMA implementation, scikit-learn and tensorflow for machine learning components, prophet for Facebook's forecasting tool, and yfinance for stock data retrieval. Installation can be completed using pip with the commands provided, ensuring all dependencies are properly configured for seamless execution of the forecasting models.

# Project Structure
The repository is organized into logical directories for better code management and clarity. The data folder contains historical stock data files, while the models directory houses individual Python files for each forecasting method (ARIMA, SARIMA, Prophet, and LSTM implementations). The notebooks folder includes Jupyter notebooks with complete analysis workflows, and the results directory stores both forecast outputs and generated visualizations. This structure facilitates easy navigation and maintenance of the codebase while separating different components of the analysis

# Usage
The implementation begins with data collection using yfinance to download Apple stock data for the specified time period. Each model can be run independently, starting with ARIMA using statsmodels with optimized parameters (5,1,2), followed by SARIMA with both non-seasonal (1,1,1) and seasonal (1,1,1,12) components. The Prophet model requires data formatting with specific column names before fitting and generating future predictions. The LSTM model involves more complex preprocessing including data normalization, sequence creation, and neural network architecture design with multiple layers for capturing temporal dependencies in the stock price movements.

# Key Insights
The analysis reveals distinct characteristics for each forecasting method, with ARIMA serving as an excellent baseline for stationary time series and achieving the best performance metrics. SARIMA demonstrates improved handling of seasonal patterns but showed only marginal improvements over ARIMA for this dataset. Prophet proved robust to missing data and outliers while providing interpretable trend and seasonal components, making it valuable for business applications. The LSTM model, while capable of capturing complex non-linear patterns, required more extensive hyperparameter tuning and larger datasets to achieve optimal performance, suggesting that traditional statistical methods may be more suitable for this particular forecasting task.

 # Visualizations
The project generates comprehensive visualizations to aid in model interpretation and comparison. Time series plots display actual versus predicted values for each model, allowing for visual assessment of forecasting accuracy across different time periods. Forecast comparison charts show all four models' predictions simultaneously, highlighting differences in their future projections. Error distribution analysis provides insights into prediction reliability, while an interactive dashboard consolidates performance metrics for easy comparison. Additionally, the Prophet model includes component decomposition plots that separate trend, seasonal, and residual components for deeper understanding of the underlying patterns.

# Model Evaluation Metrics
Model evaluation employs three key metrics to assess forecasting performance comprehensively. Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) measures the standard deviation of prediction errors, giving higher weight to larger errors and providing insight into overall prediction accuracy. Mean Absolute Error (MAE) calculates the average absolute difference between predicted and actual values, offering a more interpretable measure of typical prediction errors. Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) expresses accuracy as a percentage, making it easier to understand relative performance and compare results across different scales or datasets.

# Future Enhancements
Several improvements could enhance the project's capabilities and accuracy. Advanced LSTM architectures including GRU and Bidirectional LSTM could potentially improve deep learning performance. Ensemble methods combining predictions from multiple models might yield better overall accuracy than individual approaches. Real-time data streaming capabilities would enable live forecasting applications, while integration of additional technical indicators could provide more context for predictions. Automated hyperparameter tuning using techniques like grid search or Bayesian optimization could optimize model performance, and extending support for multiple stocks simultaneously would increase the project's practical utility.
